I am looking to sell to someone with a good job history and a strong down payment. The house is 4 bedrooms, with 3 bathrooms and an inground pool. The kitchen has had some updating while other parts of the house will need some cosmetic work. You can do improvements while you live there! I usually get 10-20% down on owner financed houses, so reach out to me if this is something you may be interested in. The total sales price is $129,000, and the monthly payment will be at or around $950 depending on your down payment. I will not bother with a credit check. I will use your income as qualification (must have the down payment and 3x the monthly payment in verifiable income). F & Qs 1. Do I own the home? Do I have a closing? We close with a local title company or closing attorney. You own the home. We take back the note just like a bank. 2. What is the rate and down payment? Down payment and rate depend on income, but it is not unusual to get $15k -$20k down. Sometimes we get more. We usually do your payment on a 20- or 30-year term, no balloons or prepayment penalties. 3. What if I make changes to the home? Itâs your home, make it your home. All we are worried about are the payments being make on time. Feel free to make changes to YOUR home. 4. I am interested in the home and have a reasonable down payment, how do I see the home?  Email us with your down payment and when you are wanting to move. We will set up a reasonable time to see the home.",31.7248,-83.2495,"ga"

What began as the home of some of the city's most prominent citizens, has evolved into one of it's most vibrant and eclectic areas. Anchored by Forest Park, and the many civic and cultural institutions it has to offer, it's a gem in the region. With large mansions and college dorms a like, families and empy nesters, the Central West End is home to a diverse group of people. The history of the area provides for great architecture, merging the detail of the original buildings with the modern lines of the ones that would follow. With world class hospitals such as Barnes and St. Louis Children's, and top colleges and universities such as Wash U., SLU, and St. Louis College of Pharmacy, the neighborhood is always a buzz with people in the midst of work and play. Strong neighborhood spirit has provided for the renovation of the area over the years, providing spaces for the unique shops, restaurants, pubs, and nightlife that not only the people of the neighborhood, but also the region, enjoy. Imagine the endless possibilities of a neighborhood that offers visitors the chance to imagine, create, explore, unwind and dream.Â The Central West EndÂ â where the familiar moniker of Eat, Play, Shop is too bland a description for this vibrant, elegant, diverse and eclectic neighborhood where visitors canÂ meander down tree-shaded streets lined with iconic winged griffin lamp posts, flowers, and stunning historic homes that date back to the 1904 Worldâs Fair in Forest Park. Located just west of downtown, the pedestrian-friendly Central West End is nestled between Forest Park and the Saint Louis University campus. Nearby are the Washington University School of Medicine, the BJC Healthcare campus, the St. Louis College of Pharmacy and the Cortex Innovation Community, a national leader in tech startups. The CWE business district stretches just under a mile on Euclid and provides the perfect set-up for walking its entire length. The district is home to more than 75 restaurants, bars and businesses that will satisfy any vacation to-do list. From downtown take the MetroLink light rail to the Central West End station.
