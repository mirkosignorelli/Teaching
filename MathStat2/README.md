# Datasets for Mathematical Statistics 2

## Lecture 1

* **Rents data** : [`rents.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mirkosignorelli/Teaching/main/MathStat2/rents.csv). 
This dataset contains a subset of 991 rows [from a larger dataset posted on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rkb0023/houserentpredictiondataset).
* The `cars` and `heights` datasets are respectively part of base `R` and of the [`brolgar` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brolgar/index.html).

## Lecture 2

* **US National Election Survey**: [`nes.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avehtari/ROS-Examples/535210007acc89087323ff71019c16f1771b3c5e/NES/data/nes.txt). Source: this dataset is used in Chapter 13 of ["Regression and Other Stories"](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/)
* The `gala` dataset is part of the [`R` package `faraway`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/faraway/index.html), which complements the book ["Extending the Linear Model with R"](https://julianfaraway.github.io/faraway/ELM/)
