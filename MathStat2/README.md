# Datasets for Mathematical Statistics 2 (module on Longitudinal Data Analysis)

This repository lists the datasets used during the short course on **Longitudinal Data Analysis** that I teach as part of **Mathematical Statistics 2** (bachelor programme in Mathematics). The course material is available through Brightspace.

## Course material

All course material is available on the Brightspace page of the course.

## Lecture 1 (linear regression and LMMs)

* **Heights data**: [`heights.RData`](https://github.com/mirkosignorelli/Teaching/blob/main/MathStat2/heights.RData)
* **Rents data** : [`rents.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mirkosignorelli/Teaching/main/MathStat2/rents.csv)
This dataset contains a subset of 991 rows [from a larger dataset posted on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rkb0023/houserentpredictiondataset).
* The `cars` dataset is part of base `R`

## Lecture 2 (LMMs and GLMs)

* **Heights data**: [`heights.RData`](https://github.com/mirkosignorelli/Teaching/blob/main/MathStat2/heights.RData)
* **US National Election Survey**: [`nes.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avehtari/ROS-Examples/535210007acc89087323ff71019c16f1771b3c5e/NES/data/nes.txt). Source: this dataset is used in Chapter 13 of ["Regression and Other Stories"](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/)
* The `gala` dataset is part of the [`R` package `faraway`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/faraway/index.html), which complements the book ["Extending the Linear Model with R"](https://julianfaraway.github.io/faraway/ELM/)

## Lecture 3 (GLMMs)

* The `bolus` dataset is available in the [`cold` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cold/index.html).
